Deployed: [Crave-It!](https://crispysodium.github.io/crave_masters/)

An application that allows hungry users to find what they are craving to eat.  It gives users the option to search for a recipe or find a restaurant.  After selecting to find a recipe or restaurant, the users will be presented with a list of cuisine types to select.  After selecting, the users will be presented with either a random recipe of that cuisine type or a list of restaurants within 25 miles of their current location.

## user story

The user could also enter any allergies or dietary preferences/need they have which would be used to remove any recipes that contains those ingredients or doesn't meet their diet.  
* Customize the greeting based on the time of day.  Based on time of day it could tailor the recipes for breakfast/lunch/dinner or restaurants that are open 
* Give users a list of recipes to choose vs. presenting a random one to users 
* Provide a map that shows the user's specific location and restaurants around them based on their cuisine type
* Allow users to view both recipes and restaurants side-by-side
* Allow users to search for a type of cuisine and not limited to the categories given
* Allow users to expand/reduce their search area or enter a city to search for restaurants vs. using their current location
