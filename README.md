# crave it! :heart_eyes:
An application that allows hungry users to find what they are craving to eat.  It gives users the option to search for a recipe or find a restaurant.  After selecting to find a recipe or restaurant, the users will be presented with a list of cuisine types to select.  After selecting, the users will be presented with either a random recipe of that cuisine type or a list of restaurants within 25 miles of their current location. 

## recipes
The recipe will have the ingredients and quantity, instructions and a video that they can watch showing how to cook it.  If they like the recipe, they can select to save it which stores in the browser's local storage.  They can select to view a list of their saved recipes which they can select to view the instructions to cook again.  

## restaurants
From the list of restaurants, users can select to order online GrubHub if available or can select the address to find the restaurant's location and information on Google Maps.

# site enhancements
* Add a profile page that gathers the user's information to personalize the experience. The information collected would be the user's name to be used in greetings when the app is loaded. The user could also enter any allergies or dietary preferences/need they have which would be used to remove any recipes that contains those ingredients or doesn't meet their diet.  
* Customize the greeting based on the time of day.  Based on time of day it could tailor the recipes for breakfast/lunch/dinner or restaurants that are open 
* Give users a list of recipes to choose vs. presenting a random one to users 
* Provide a map that shows the user's specific location and restuarants around them based on their cuisine type
* Allow users to view both recipes and restarants side-by-side
* Allow users to search for a type of cuisine and not limited to the categories given
* Allow users to expand/reduce their search area or enter a city to search for restuarants vs. using their current location
